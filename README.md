# **I. Vision Statement** #
The **video game** we are looking to create is **for** both new and hardcore fans of turn-based strategy games alike and fans of physical or digital board games **who** have played games in their libraries front-to-back and found themselves totally devoid of any interest in playing the same games for the tenth time. 

The game we create **will lead to** another fantastic addition to video game fans’ libraries to which they can dump all of their hours into and hopefully spark a change in the video game industry, while expanding the developers’ software and video game design knowledge. 

**Unlike our competitors** in the genre, such as X-COM and Hand of Fate, we look to **offer** a multi-layer style game that will place the player into an immersive, board-game like strategic layer, where choices the player makes will help or hinder them on their journey, and combining it with a turn-based tactical layer, where micromanaging and thorough planning can bring the player victory. 

By combining these ideas from various games and forming them into one cohesive package, we can hopefully show that the melding of different mechanics from seemingly different games can yield fun and long-lasting results.
